=====================================

This is a collection of my environment files.
In particular, my zsh, git, tmux settings.

My zsh settings are largely inspired by oh-my-zsh.
Check out oh-my-zsh or prezto if new to zsh.

My vim settings can be found here [vimrc settings](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)
